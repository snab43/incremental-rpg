# Incremental RPG [WIP]
Just an idea for an incremental based RPG that's mobile-first in design.

You can test the current build here: [incremental-rpg.netlify.app](https://incremental-rpg.netlify.app/)

## Install
**Requirement:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/).

To run this code locally, after pulling the repo just run `npm install` in the root directory. This will install SASS, TypeScript, and Vite. After that, use `npm run dev` to start the local development server.

If you want to build it, use `npm run build` and it will output to a `/dist` folder with an `index.html` file you can open.

## Built With
Vite, HTML, SASS, and TypeScript.
