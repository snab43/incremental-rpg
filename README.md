# Incremental RPG [WIP]
Just an idea for an incremental based RPG that's mobile-first in design.

## Install
To run this code locally, after pulling the repo just run `npm install`. After that, use `npm run dev` to start the local development server. If you want to build it, use `npm run build` and it will output to a `/dist` folder with an `index.html` file you can open.
